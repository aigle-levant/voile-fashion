          Based in Lyon, Voile seeks to understand the fundamental differences
          in the fashion of the yesteryears. Our goal is to accurately portray
          noticeable fashion differences in the different cultures formed in the
          world, not only from the Western world, but chiefly, from the world
          beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Voile is a tribute to the unseen cultures thought to have been
          disappeared in the world as well as the uncommon cultural differences
          of humanity. We believe that humanity, although flawed, can celebrate
          their cultural belongings and differences.
